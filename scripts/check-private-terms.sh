# Usage: check-private-terms.sh --cached | <file-with-message>. The .private-terms denylist over the whole index (the
# pre-commit hook) or over a commit message (the commit-msg hook). .private-terms is gitignored: one extended regex per
# line, case-insensitive, # for comments. A linked worktree has no copy of it, so it uses the main worktree's.
# git grep and grep exit 1 for no match and above 1 when they cannot search (a malformed pattern). That is not a pass:
# it blocks the commit too.
